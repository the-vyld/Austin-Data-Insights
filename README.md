# Austin-Data-Insights

Extracted Austin hotel listings data from AirBNB, more accurately the listings.csv containing the info of listings, host, neighbourhood, reviews etc. and neighbourhood.geojson storing the coordinate information and polygons of neighbourhoods.

Extracted some useful insights like top areas with highest no. of listings and mapped those areas with their corresponding neighbourhood polygons.

Also extracted top 10 hosts wrt no. of listings

Made a thematic map using polygon info from neighbourhood.geojson and the latitude / longitude info from listings.csv and visualised a scatter plot of 'single room' and 'whole building' listing types.
